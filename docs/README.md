# Crio Launch Portfolio

Crio Launch is a program that I did in the months of Feburary and March, it was an internship-cum-course in which I had build 3 Projects, referred as Micro-Experiences. You can access
the Portfolio provided by Crio at "[Crio.Do Portfolio Pranav Khurana](https://criodo.github.io/Crio-Launch-Feb-2020-apranavkhurana18/)". 

In this Crio Program, I did the following three Projects: -

* ### QBox

  QBox is a secure file-sharing service. It is a customized version of the popularly available VSFTPD server. During the course of this Micro-Experience:
 
    ``` 
    1. I created pre-install scripts to run system checks, install and configure QBox.
    2. I, also developed tools to automatically analyze performance and functionality issues in different
       versions of QBox.
    ```     
   
   > **Skills Learned:** Linux Commands, OS Concepts, Networking Concepts, Network Security
 
* ### QMoney

  QMoney is a visual stock portfolio analyzer. It helps portfolio managers make trade recommendations for their clients. During the course of this Micro-Experience:

    ```
    1. Implemented the core logic of the portfolio manager and published it as a library.
    2. Refactored code to add support for multiple stock quote services.
    3. Improved application stability and performance.
    ```

  > **Skills Learned:** Java, REST API, Jackson, Interfaces, Code Refactoring, Gradle 
    
* ### QPrep

  Learn and Practice algorithmic problems in a structured way. During the course of this QPrep Micro-Experience, we were expected to solve problems in a structured way by:

    ```
    1. First articulating the problem statement clearly with examples.
    2. Brainstorming multiple approaches, understanding trade-offs and writing pseudocode for the chosen approach.
    3. Implementing the solution and testing it.
    ```

  The deliberate divide-and-conquer practice helps the developer to approach unknown problems with reasonable confidence.
